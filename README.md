# Shipin AR

## Summary
Shipin AR is an augmented reality application developed with Vufira in Unity for Android mobile devices. The underlying idea is to leverage AR labels in helping Chinese language students of NYU Shanghai in improving oral communication skills. The application can scan objects found in a typical convencience store and provide labels about new vocabulary as well as sample questions that the user can ask from the shop assistants. Currently, this application is a prototype and it demonstrates its capacities with annotating a toothbrush.

## The AR User Interface
After careful examination of various AR applications, the most conducive to learning goals was annotation of objects with labels. To the right side of the object, labels tags appear that highlight the vocabulary and place them into a sample question. Further iterations would include direct labeling of text on objects, however that may be less conducive to the specific vocabulary that the student needs to master at his or her level.

## Integration of Sound and Pinyin
The peculiarity of the Chinese language is its tonality. As one of the aspects of the language that the student is required to master, sound recording of the questions were integrated into the AR lables. Upon touching the AR labels, the students can readily listen to the sound recording of the question, as well as toggle to the Pinyin view to see the tones of the words.
